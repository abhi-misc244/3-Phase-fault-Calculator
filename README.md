# 3-Phase-fault-Calculator
Electrical Engineering - Three phase fault calculation using Python. Needs a User interface and code needs to be optimised. Data entry file needs to be developed into a better user interface using pygame or something similar. Y Bus could also be created using actual impedances via impedance matrix.
